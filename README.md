# Rocket maze

This is my first Samsung Watch (Tizen) app.
It's a game inspired by an old game called [Crazy Gravity](https://classicreload.com/win9x-crazy-gravity.html).

Basically the goal is to fly your rocketship from the starting position to the ending position without crashing into a wall. Crashing into a wall results in a spectacular explosion :)

The game currently has 3 levels, but is still very much a work in progress.
