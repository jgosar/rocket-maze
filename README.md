# Rocket maze

This is my first Samsung Watch (Tizen) app.
It's a game inspired by an old game called [Crazy Gravity](https://classicreload.com/win9x-crazy-gravity.html).

Basically the goal is to fly your rocketship from the starting position to the ending position without crashing into a wall. 
Crashing into a wall results in a spectacular explosion :)

The control inputs are as follows:
- Rotate bezel: Rotates the rocket
- Tap screen: Fire engine
- Back button: Respawns the rocket after you crash

The game currently has 3 levels, but is still very much a work in progress.

## Try it in a browser

Since this is a completely normal HTML+JS+CSS app, it's also playable in the browser, although the experience is not as good, especially regarding the speed at which you can rotate the ship. The game is available [here](https://jgosar.github.io/rocket-maze/index.html).
Key mappings for testing the game on the PC are as follows:
- Bezel rotate left => A
- Bezel rotate right => D
- Tap screen => W
- Back button => Esc
